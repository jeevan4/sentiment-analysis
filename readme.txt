Performed Sentiment Analysis as part of Bigdata class challenge over a large movie review dataset found here: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ 

The dataset contains binary sentiment classification for 50,000 highly polar movie reviews.

Tasks Done :

Implemented in Hadoop file system as the dataset is large. Done the following in MapReduce with Hadoop Streaming API.

1. Preprocessing : removed html tags, junk characters, stop words and performed stemming.
2. Data Representation : Bag-of-words representation.SciKit Learn toolboxâ€™s feature_extraction module is used to generate a matrix of token counts.
3. Classification : Used Random Forest to classify the reviews. Trained the model with train dataset and predicted the unknown labels for test dataset
4. Evaluation : Predicted the unknown labels with an accuray of 84.984

Confusion Matrix :

[10735  1765]
[ 1989 10511]
